# SMS-Spam-Detection
**Project Title: SMS Spam Detection**

**Introduction:**
The SMS Spam Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model that can effectively classify text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). With the proliferation of mobile devices and the increase in text message usage, the issue of unsolicited spam messages has become a significant concern for users. By building a robust spam detection system, we can help users filter out unwanted messages, thereby improving their overall experience and security.

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying spam messages. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model will analyze the content of text messages and classify them as either spam or ham.

**Dataset:**
The project utilizes a dataset consisting of labeled SMS messages, where each message is categorized as either spam or ham. The dataset contains a collection of text messages along with their corresponding labels, allowing the model to learn from the provided examples.

**Methodology:**
1. **Data Preprocessing:** The text data undergoes preprocessing steps such as tokenization, removing stop words, and stemming to extract meaningful features from the messages.
2. **Feature Extraction:** The preprocessed text data is converted into numerical feature vectors using techniques like CountVectorizer or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
3. **Model Training:** The feature vectors are used to train a machine learning classifier, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest, on the labeled dataset.
4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, a confusion matrix is generated to analyze the classification results.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The model's hyperparameters may be tuned to optimize performance and generalization ability.
6. **Model Deployment:** Once the model achieves satisfactory performance, it can be deployed in production to classify incoming text messages in real-time.

**Results:**
The project aims to achieve high accuracy and robustness in classifying SMS messages as spam or ham. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score will be used to assess the model's performance. Additionally, visualizations such as confusion matrices may be utilized to gain insights into the model's behavior.

**Conclusion:**
By developing an accurate and efficient SMS spam detection system, this project contributes to enhancing user experience and security in the domain of mobile communication. The model's ability to effectively filter out unwanted messages can help users avoid potential scams, phishing attempts, and other malicious activities associated with spam messages.
